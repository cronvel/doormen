-------

New schema feature: support for immutable properties


v0.15.5

v0.15.4
-------

Release with: NaN bug in patch fixed, bracket in patch path bug (instead of dot) fixed, new: doormen.mergePatch()


v0.15.3
-------

New assertions: unordered equal/like


v0.15.2
-------

IMPORTANT BUGFIX: last release introduced an .isEqual() bug that happens whenever a property is enumerable on one side and not-enumerable on the other


v0.15.1
-------

Fix: .isEqual() now check enumerable Symbols


v0.15.0
-------

BREAKING: Dependency upgrade requires node >= v16.13


v0.14.9

v0.13.0
-------

New: expect.each(), assert.onlyUniqueValues()
BREAKING assertion change: seperated 'have' and 'contain/include' assertion, they have a different meaning for objects having a .has() method (used by 'have', but not by contain/include), practically, 'contain/include' behavior changed for Map instances! ('contain' check if the Map have value, 'have' if the Map have the key... for Set it changes nothing since .has() check values)

Fix AssertionError#expectationPath to remove the '.' at the begining of the path, to be compliant with tree-kit's dotPath()


v0.12.0
-------

Maybe breaking -- new .isEqual.getLastPath() returns the dot-path to the part of the object that was not equal
AssertionError now add the offending path to the error message (if any) and also have 'expectationPath' and 'showPathDiff' properties.

--------

Dependencies upgraded


v0.10.20
--------

Browser light version


v0.10.19

--------

Better 'around' assertion, .isEqual() support epsilon-aware comparison


v0.10.17
--------
