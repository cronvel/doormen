Validate, sanitize and assert: the silver bullet of data!

Beta version.

**/!\\ This documentation is still a Work In Progress /!\\**



## Basic validation

* sanitize `Array` of `string` the sanitizer's name to apply before any type checking
* optional `boolean` the data can be `null` or `undefined`, if so the data validate immediately
* default (anything) the data can be `null` or `undefined`, if so it is overwritten by the default value and it validates immediately
* type `string` the name of the type checker
* instanceOf
* min
* max
* length
* minLength
* maxLength
* match
* in
* notIn
* when
* properties `object` of schema, it iterates through each properties and checks that they all match their own schema
* elements `Array` same than properties but for arrays
* only `boolean` used in conjunction with *properties* or *elements*, it checks that no properties other than those listed are present
* of `object` contains one schema that will check each elements of an array or each properties



## Type Checkers

Javascript primitive types:

* undefined: the data should be `undefined`
* null: the data should be `null`
* boolean: the data should be a `boolean`, i.e. `true` or `false`
* number: the data should be a `number`. **NOTE** that `Infinity` and `NaN` are ok, so you may consider using *real*
  instead of *number* in almost all cases
* string: the data should be a `string`
* object: the data should be an `Object`
* function: the data should be a `Function`


Javascript/Node.js built-in types:

* array: the data should be an `Array`
* error: the data should be an instance of `Error`
* date: the data should be an instance of `Date`
* buffer: the data should be a Node.js `Buffer`
                                        

Common meta types:

* real: a `number` that is not `NaN` nor +/- `Infinity`
* integer: a `number` that is not `NaN` nor +/- `Infinity`, and that do not have decimal part



## Sanitizers

* toNumber: try to convert a `string` to a `number`
* trim: trim a `string`, removing whitespace at the beginning and the end
